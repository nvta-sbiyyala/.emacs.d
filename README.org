* !!UPDATE!! Dec 2022
I am moving away from maintaining my personal emacs dot files, trying out [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/][spacemacs]]. ~vterm~ is missing from the stock ~spacemacs~ config, this snippet needs to be added to ~init.el~
#+name: emacs-lisp-hello-world
#+begin_src elisp :exports both 
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/git/emacs-libvterm")
  (require 'vterm)
  ;; Make emacs window title show path of current file
  (setq-default frame-title-format
                '(:eval
                  (format "Happy Hacking! %s"
                          (buffer-name)
                          (cond
                           (buffer-file-truename
                            (concat "(" buffer-file-truename ")"))
                           (dired-directory
                            (concat "{" dired-directory "}"))
                           (t
                            "[no file]")))))
#+end_src

** Current themes of interest
1. cyberpunk (FTW!)
2. +dracula+
3. +spacemacs-dark+

** emacs shell of choice
~vterm~ is the best shell for ~emacs~ in my opinion
